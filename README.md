# compiled_altium_jlcpcb_libraries
A compiled Integrated library of gsuberland's JLCPCB Basic parts library
This is a compiled version of Graham Suberlands excellent JLCPCB library.

I added the basic footprints to it, created with Altiums built in IPC compliant footprint generator for medium density.
I would advice against using this, as this is here mostly for my own beenefit. Please read the readme at the original repo these are from.
